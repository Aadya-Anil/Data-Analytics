This document lists the GenAI prompts used during each task of the Tata iQ Data Analytics Job Simulation on Forage. These prompts supported EDA, modeling, business reporting, and strategy proposal.

##  Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Step 1: Review & Summarize Dataset
- "Summarize the structure, key variables, and data quality issues in this dataset."
- "Highlight missing values, outliers, and problematic fields for modeling delinquency."
- "Which columns show the highest potential as predictors for delinquency?"

### Step 2: Handle Missing Data
- "Suggest an imputation strategy for missing income and credit utilization values."
- "Is it better to drop or impute variables with over 20% missing data?"
- "Generate synthetic income values for missing entries using a normal distribution."

### Step 3: Risk Profiling
- "Which behavioral and financial indicators are most associated with credit delinquency?"
- "Detect patterns that suggest a customer may become delinquent."
- "List early warning signals based on payment history trends."

##  Task 2: Predictive Modeling Framework

### Step 1: Model Design
- "What model types are best for binary classification problems in financial risk prediction?"
- "Help me build a no-code decision logic framework to predict delinquency."

### Step 2: Feature Selection
- "Which features in this dataset are most predictive for delinquency?"
- "Rank features by importance for predicting binary outcomes using financial behavior data."

### Step 3: Evaluation Criteria
- "What performance metrics should I use to evaluate a credit risk model?"
- "When should I prioritize recall over accuracy in a delinquency prediction scenario?"

---

##  Task 3: Business Reporting & Recommendations

### Step 1: Executive Summary
- "Summarize key findings from my EDA and model plan in 3â€“5 business-focused bullet points."
- "How would you explain credit risk indicators to a non-technical stakeholder?"

### Step 2: Strategic Recommendations
- "Suggest interventions to reduce delinquency based on model insights."
- "How should we prioritize high-risk customer segments for outreach?"

### Step 3: Risk Communication
- "How can I communicate model predictions ethically and clearly to a finance team?"
- "What disclaimers should I include about model limitations?"

---

##  Task 4: AI-Driven Collections System Design

### Step 1: Workflow Design
- "Help me outline a modular AI collections strategy that adapts to customer behavior."
- "What components should be included in an automated collections workflow?"

### Step 2: Compliance & Ethics
- "How can I make my collections system ethically responsible and explainable?"
- "List AI fairness and compliance guidelines relevant to finance automation."

### Step 3: Scalability & Feedback
- "How can I integrate feedback loops to improve model accuracy over time?"
- "Propose a scalable implementation plan for an AI-first collections system."

## Summary

These prompts were used across the simulation to:
- Accelerate data exploration
- Inform risk modeling and intervention strategies
- Align AI systems with ethics and regulation
- Communicate findings effectively with stakeholders
